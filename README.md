# Assignment_6

Description:
In this assignment you are given a style sheet with premade id's and classes. Your job will be to place the id's and classes to recreate the image you see up top. There are some bits of code that have already been completed, these are examples for you to use. Please, break and play with any of the code after you submit the assignment. I've played around with quite a few style properties we haven't touched on yet.

Purpose:
While we discussed Divs and Spans in class, you'll really only know when and how to use them when constructing your own code. What I've done here is created some small examples of how you would nest elements with divs. Your job will be to figure out which divs are parent to which elements, and where to attach the right style set to replicate the screen shot. I've written quite a bit of style, but if you read through and play with numbers, you should get a feel for what is happening where. This is also a good example of how combinators work. Don't over think this assignment, it took far longer for me to construct than to should take to complete.

Outline:
In the supplied assignment folder you'll find an index, an images folder, and a style sheet. There are 5 tags you need to use to put the index back together.

#hero-image
#left-container
#right-container
.left-picture
.right-picture

Using the materials provided and what we discussed in class about divs, ids, and classes ( I didn't include spans because all the divs are specific to layout, and spans being inline didn't serve a purpose ) you will add the correct attributes to the correct tags, a mix of <img> and <div>.
